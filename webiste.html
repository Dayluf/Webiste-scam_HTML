<p class="underheaders">What is a internett scam, and how does it work?</p>

    <div class="text">An internet scam is a fraudulent scheme conducted online with the aim of deceiving individuals,
        organizations, or businesses for financial gain or other malicious purposes.
        Internet scams come in various forms and can target people through emails, social media, online advertisements,
        websites, or other online platforms. Here are some common types of internet scams and how they work:
        <ul>
            Phishing:
            How it works: Scammers create fake websites or emails that mimic legitimate ones to trick individuals into providing sensitive information such as usernames,
            passwords, credit card details, or personal information.
            <br>
            <br>
            Online Shopping Scams:
            How it works: Fraudsters create fake online stores or auction sites to sell products that either don't exist or are significantly different from what is advertised. 
            Victims pay for goods that they never receive. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Romance Scams:
            How it works: Scammers build fake online relationships with individuals, often through dating websites or social media. 
            Once trust is established, they request money for various reasons, such as a supposed emergency or travel expenses.
            Example: A scammer creates a fake online dating profile, develops a relationship with the victim, and then fabricates a crisis, asking for financial assistance.
            <br>
            <br>
            Investment Scams:
            How it works: Scammers promote fake investment opportunities, promising high returns with little or no risk. Victims invest money but never see the promised returns.
            Example: A fraudulent investment firm convinces individuals to invest in a fake cryptocurrency or a non-existent high-return scheme.
        </ul>

<p class="underheaders">How can i protect myself?</p>

    <div class="text">Protecting yourself against internet scams requires a combination of awareness,
        caution, and adopting good cybersecurity practices. Here are some tips to help you minimize the risk of falling victim to internet scams:
        <ul>
            Be Skeptical of Unsolicited Communications:
            Be cautious of unsolicited emails, messages, or phone calls, especially those that claim you've won a prize, need urgent action, or request personal information.
            <br>
            <br>
            Verify Email Addresses and URLs:
            Check the sender's email address to verify its legitimacy. Be cautious of emails with misspelled or suspicious domain names.
            Hover over links in emails to preview the URL before clicking. Avoid clicking on links in emails from unknown or unexpected sources.
            <br>
            <br>
            Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):
            Enable 2FA wherever possible to add an extra layer of security to your accounts. 
            This typically involves receiving a one-time code on your phone or email in addition to entering your password.
