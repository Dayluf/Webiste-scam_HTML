<p class="underheaders">What is a internett scam, and how does it work?</p>

<div class="text">An internet scam is a fraudulent scheme conducted online with the aim of deceiving individuals, organizations, or businesses for financial gain or other malicious purposes.
     Internet scams come in various forms and can target people through emails, social media, online advertisements, websites, or other online platforms.
      Here are some common types of internet scams and how they work:
    Phishing:
    How it works: Scammers create fake websites or emails that mimic legitimate ones to trick individuals into providing sensitive information such as usernames,
    passwords, credit card details, or personal information.
    Online Shopping Scams:
    How it works: Fraudsters create fake online stores or auction sites to sell products that either don't exist or are significantly different from what is advertised. 
    Victims pay for goods that they never receive.</div>
